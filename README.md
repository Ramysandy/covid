## Overview

This thesis explores the design and implementation of predictive modeling systems using artificial intelligence to analyze viral evolution and forecast pandemic outbreaks. The project focuses on SARS-CoV-2 and integrates multiple modules for mutation tracking, data visualization, genomic analysis, epidemiological surveillance, and collaborative research.

## Project Components

### 1. Genetic Mutation and Variant Tracking
- **Real-time Variant Database**  
  Displays the latest SARS-CoV-2 genetic mutations with up-to-date information from genomic repositories.

- **Variant Geographic Spread Map**  
  Visualizes the global distribution and emergence of new variants.

- **Phylogenetic Tree Visualization**  
  Depicts the evolutionary relationships among different SARS-CoV-2 lineages.

- **Lineage List**  
  A structured list of known lineages for reference and comparative analysis.

---

### 2. Genetic Studies and Data Analysis
- **Genomic Data Repository**  
  A central database to store viral genome sequences for processing and analysis.

- **AI-driven Mutation Prediction**  
  Uses machine learning models to forecast potential future genetic mutations.

- **Mutation Comparison Tool**  
  Enables comparison between genetic sequences of different variants.

- **Mutation Impact Analysis**  
  Predicts the potential functional effects of mutations on viral behavior.

### 3. Pandemic Alert and Surveillance (Epidemiological Data)
- **AI-based Early Warning System**  
  Detects potential outbreak patterns using AI/ML algorithms and historical data.

- **Epidemiological Trends Dashboard**  
  Provides real-time tracking of COVID-19 case counts, mortality and infection trends, and emergency department visits by state.

- **Wastewater Surveillance Integration**  
  Incorporates viral load monitoring from wastewater samples to enable early detection of outbreaks.

---

### 4. Research and Government Collaboration
- **Research Paper Aggregation**  
  Collects and indexes recent scientific studies related to SARS-CoV-2.

- **Government Policy Tracker**  
  Monitors global public health policies and pandemic-related measures.

- **Secure Research Collaboration Hub**  
  A dedicated portal to support secure data-sharing and analysis among government and institutional researchers.

---

## Final Output

- **Customizable Data Reports**  
  Automatically generates PDF reports that compile data from all modules for research dissemination and policy reporting.

## Purpose

This system is designed to assist researchers, public health officials, and policy-makers by providing comprehensive tools for viral genome analysis, mutation prediction, real-time outbreak surveillance, and collaborative research support. It aims to enhance pandemic preparedness and response through data-driven insights and AI-powered forecasting.
